- 👋 Hello, my name is Dimitar Mitranov and I am an IT student from Bulgaria!
I currently study in New Bulgarian University and SotfUni.
I am also an Intern at Cerillion PLC. I am part of the Deployment Team here in Bulgaria!

- 👀 Here is a list of some of the things I am able to do:
I can write code on C#, Java, C++, JavaScript. I know the basics of Python as well.
Able to work with Operating Systems and their Shells, it is part of my work after all.
I know CRUD operations over Databases and am able to fluently work with them. Have only worked with SQL Databases so far.
Lastly I know some basic HTML & CSS and can manipulate the DOM Tree of web pages, though I am not a front end lover.
I prefer more algorithmic and technical problems.

- 🌱 Currently I try to deepen my knowledge in Linux Operating Systems.
I also study Java Hibernate and Spring right now!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Nothing right now. I want to use GitHub to browse
different repositories, to create contacts and also to upload some of the programs I write.
For now they aren't gonna be anything special, since I haven't worked on long-term projects.
Thus I do not have complex projects I could showcase here, though I am capable of writing such.
For now I am going to upload day-to-day exercises I solve at my universities and have fun.
When I have more free time I may work on some interesting projects.
